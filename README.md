# packet-stories

This repository contains a small Jekyll static site intended for GitHub Pages. To publish the site create a repository on GitHub called `packet-stories`, push these files to the default branch, and enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings. The site will be available at https://spw571.github.io/packet-stories if you use a project page.

If you want the site at https://packet-stories.github.io, create a repository named `packet-stories` in your personal account and push to the default branch. GitHub will build it automatically with Jekyll.
